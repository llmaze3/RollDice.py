# RollDice.py
Creating two dice to roll. I am using the time.sleep() function to give the illusion that two dice are rolling and the user as to wait for the numbers. If the numbers are the same then the program tells the user there is a double. The user can stop the program by inputing "N" or keey the game going by inputing "Y" or many different variations of "Yes". 

# What I Learned

- Pyhton while loop.
- Creating a boolean variable.
